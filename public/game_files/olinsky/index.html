		</span>
		<br/>
		<p>
			You should switch your browser to full screen mode before starting the game.  This can usually be done by going to View &#8594; Full Screen or by clicking outside the applet and pressing F11.  Repeat the process to exit full screen mode.  The Apple Safari and Google Chrome browser do not have a full screen modes.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			If the applet does not run properly, you may need to <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1">update Java</a>.

				Controls
			</span>
			<br/>
			The game uses mainly A, S, D, W, ENTER, and SHIFT.  You use A, S, D, and W like the arrow keys.  Use A and D to move left and right.  ENTER and W will make Olinsky jump.  Press S to end your jump at any point.  Press SHIFT to punch.  Due to glitches that may occur when walking, I have allowed players to switch between the normal walking graphic and the standing graphic by pressing "~" at any time.  You can return to the title screen at any time by pressing ESC (always return to the title screen before quitting) and shut off the background music by pressing BACKSPACE (press BACKSPACE again to turn the music back on).  The game will run faster with the background music off.

				Enemies
			</span>
			<br/>
			Whenever you touch an enemy, you will lose health and become invincible for a few seconds.  If you press ENTER or W the moment you land on an enemy's head, you will jump off withouot taking damage.  This can help you reach higher places but requires very good timing.  It usually works better with dead enemies.

								Slackoids
							</span>
							<br/>
							These useless enemies just stand and stare at you.  A single punch will eliminate one...or more.  Just because they are weak does not mean you can touch one and expect it not to hurt you.

								Blastoids
							</span>
							<br/>
							Blastoids are more intelligent than Slackoids.  They also have ray guns.  It takes two hits to kill one, and you also have to dodge their lasers.  Sometimes they are surrounded by a shield of Slackoids, which you must destroy while dodging the lasers.

				Gameplay
			</span>
			<br/>
			You start each level in a transport beam, which also prevents you from moving to the left.  You must battle your way through enemies to the end.  At the end of each level is an alien power supply device.  Destroy the red column to shut off the device.  This will cut off power from the nearby alien ships, forcing them to leave and allowing you to proceed to the next part of camp.  On the map screen, you can go to any level you have cleared.  Levels are marked on the map by small orange dots.

				Power-Ups
			</span>
			<br/>
			Grab one of these power-ups to become temporarily invincible.  You will also glide slightly above the ground.  While invincible, Olinsky will flash and have a white outline.

			Instructions &#8212; Song Session:
		</span>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Song session is not available in the demo version.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The timing may be slightly off on slower computers.
			<br/>

			<span class="subhead">
				Controls
			</span>
			<br/>
			The controls are meant to be like banging on a table.  The left half of the keyboard (Q, W, E, R, T, A, S, D, F, G, Z, X, C, and v) makes Olinsky bang with his left hand and the right half (I, O, P, [{, ]}, J, K, L, ;:, '", M, <,, >., and /?) makes Olinsky bang with his right hand.  Press the space bar to clap and press SHIFT to shout out words displayed to Olinsky's left.  These are usually for call-and-response sections, extra words that are not usually in the song, or other cheers.  Press ESC at any time to return to the song menu and again from there to return to the title screen.  Always return to the title screen before quitting.
